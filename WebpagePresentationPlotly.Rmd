This is a webpage presentation demonstrating plots using Plotly.  European Stock Markets data
from the "datasets" package is loaded first.  


```{R}
library(plotly)
set.seed(seed = 1)
mytoday <- Sys.Date()
mydata <- data.frame(shareValue = rnorm(n = 180, mean = 500, sd = 20),
                     valueDate = seq.Date(from = mytoday, length.out = 180, by = 1))
summary(mydata)
```

plotly is used to depict the randomly simulated stockprices for the next 6 months from today. 

```{R}
#png("p.png", width=480, height=480)
plot_ly(mydata, y = ~shareValue, x = ~valueDate, type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
```
