# CourseraDataProducts-Wk3Assignment
The Assignment is to create a Webpresentation using R Markdown to demonstrate a basic
but interactive plot created with Plotly.
Key notes -
1. Created a dataframe of 180 observations and 2 variables representing 6 month's data. The variables are StockPrice and ValueDate.
2. ValueDate was generated sequentially from current date varying by a day, for 180 days.
3. StockPrice was generated randomly.
Using plotly, a scatter plot of this dataframe was generated and has been published to github.
